                You will be prompted to name the pentatonic notes in a given key. Submit your answers either seperated by commas or spaces (not both). It is not case sensitive. 
                If you answer a question right you will get 100 points added to your score. If you get it wrong 100 points will be subtracted. 
                The game also keeps track of the time it takes you to answer each question and if you get a question right and your answer time was less than your median answer time, you get an additional 
                100 points.
