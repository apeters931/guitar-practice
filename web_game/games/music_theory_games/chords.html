            <h2> Instructions </h2>
            <p> You will be prompted to name the notes in a given chord. Submit you answers either seperated by commas or spaces (not both). It is not case sensitive. 
                Chords are catagorized into three different levels: easy, medium, and hard. You will have 70% chance of getting and easy chord, a 20% chance for a medium chord, 
                and a 10% for a hard chord any given question. If you answer a question right you will get 100 points added to your score. If you get it wrong 100 points will be subtracted. 
                For correct answers there are also multipliers that can give you more points. Medium level chords are worth 200 points and hard level are worth 300. The game also keeps 
                track of the time it takes you to answer each question and if you get a question right and your answer time was less than your median answer time you get an additional 
                100 points.</p>
